Phase 4: Performance of the project
Title : AI- Structural  health monitoring
1. AI Model Performance Enhancement
2. Performance Improvements:
•	Data Collection: Historical and real-time sensor data (e.g., vibration, strain, acoustic emission) are gathered and labeled.
•	Model Training: Machine learning models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) and deep learning architectures (e.g., CNNs for image-based crack detection, LSTMs for time-series sensor data) are trained using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Outcome
The development and deployment of AI models in Structural Health Monitoring have led to significant improvements in detection accuracy, operational efficiency, and maintenance planning.

2.sensors
Key Enhancements:
1.	Wireless and Remote Monitoring: Reduced need for manual inspection through            real-time, wireless data transmission.
2.	Multi-Functionality: Single sensors can now monitor multiple parameters (e.g., strain, temperature, humidity).
Outcome:
One of the most significant is the early detection of structural damage, allowing maintenance teams to address issues before they become critical. This proactive approach greatly enhances safety, reducing the risk of catastrophic failures in bridges, buildings, dams, and other infrastructure.


3.Data acquisition system (DAQ)performance :
Key Enhancements:
1.	High-Speed Sampling and Precision : Enhanced analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) allow for rapid and accurate data collection, crucial for capturing transient events like cracks or impacts.
2.	Multi-Channel and Modular Design :  Modern DAQs support a large number of synchronized sensor channels and can be easily expanded for large-scale monitoring systems.
Outcome:
Modern DAQs enable real-time and continuous data collection, allowing engineers to monitor the structural behavior of assets under operational and extreme conditions with high accuracy. This leads to the early detection of anomalies such as stress accumulation, cracks, or abnormal vibrations, enabling timely maintenance and reducing the risk of structural failures.
